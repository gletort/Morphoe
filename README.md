# Morphoe
Morphogenesis of olfactory epithelium.

Python code to simulate migration of early olfactory neurons along the telencephalon.
The matrix (telencephalon) is represented as an immobile and uncrossable horseshoe-like barrier (paraboloid).
Cells are distributed along the telencephalon and follow a chemotaxis gradient (mimicking Cxcl12a signalling) to converge in two clusters.
